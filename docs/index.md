## About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition 2.0 is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over half a million regular users, itâ€™s a powerful, open-source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

Portainer works by hiding the complexity that makes managing contains hard behind an easy to use GUI. By negating the need for users to use CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so simple, anyone can do it.

The Portainer development team is here to assist you on your container journey; you can engage with them any time through our community-based support channels.

## Support Channels

Our primary community support channel is [Slack](https://portainer.slack.com/), while others exist (Reddit, Discord, Stackoverflow) these are monitored much less frequently by the Portainer team. We encourage a true community approach mindset.
