# Welcome to Portainer Documentation

Welcome to the official Portainer Documentation.

## About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition 2.0 is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over half a million regular users, it’s a powerful, open-source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

Portainer works by hiding the complexity that makes managing contains hard behind an easy to use GUI. By negating the need for users to use CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so simple, anyone can do it.

The Portainer development team is here to assist you on your container journey; you can engage with them any time through our community-based support channels.

## Support Channels

As the Portainer community continues to grow, we continue to support the community to the best of our ability.  
Being a free and opensource product, we have been heavily reliant on our community to provide "how to" support to our community, recently we have invested significant time in improving and updating our documentation found on this site. While we endeavour to cover as many scenarios as possible there may be some that our documentation doesn’t cover. 

We strongly encourage posting such questions to the community via the  [Slack channel](https://portainer.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDk3ODQ5MjI2MjI4LTcwNGYxMWQ5OGViYWZkNDY2ZjY4YTMwMTgzYmU4YmNiOTU0MDcxYmJjNTIyYmQ0MTM5Y2QwNTg3NzNkMTk5MDg#/). While other platforms exist (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow) these are monitored much less frequently by the Portainer team.


If you are uncomfortable posting your question publicly you can contact us via the Contact Us widget at the bottom of screen, we will respond as soon as we are able to. 

To streamline our operations and allow us to focus on delivering the right support and features in the right areas at the right time we encourage our users to do the following:

* <b>QUESTIONS</b> should be posted either to the [Slack channel](https://portainer.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDk3ODQ5MjI2MjI4LTcwNGYxMWQ5OGViYWZkNDY2ZjY4YTMwMTgzYmU4YmNiOTU0MDcxYmJjNTIyYmQ0MTM5Y2QwNTg3NzNkMTk5MDg#/), via the Contact Us widget at the bottom of screen or via email to [support@portainer.io](mailto:support@portainer.io)
