# Endpoints Groups and Endpoint Tags

In Portainer, you will able to set up Groups and Tags to organize your endpoints. For example, you can set up a group for Development, Stage or Production and use the Tags to identify to what departament is "owner" of that resources or where is located.

## Add a Endpoint Group

Adding a Endpoint group is very easy in Portainer. Once you logged to Portainer, do a click in <b>Endpoints</b> and then in <b>Groups</b>

## Add Endpoint Tags

Using tags help you to define metadata about the nodes or resources. For example, if a node is in Los Angeles, you can set a tag to that node to have more visibility when looking for nodes running in Los Angeles. The same concept for department or "owners" of that's resources.

Once you logged to Portainer, do a click in <b>Endpoints</b> and then in <b>Tags</b>. Define a name for your Tag and do a click in <b>Create Tag</b>.
