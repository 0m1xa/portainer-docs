# Manage Endpoint Access

Portainer is capable of managing the access to the endpoints. This management can be broad or granular, depends on what you need. Teams and/or users can be added to manage an Endpoint.

Access tagged as inherited are inherited from the group access. They cannot be removed or modified at the endpoint level but they can be overriden.

Access tagged as override are overriding the group access for the related users/teams.

## Adding a Team or User

Adding access to a Team or User to the endpoint is very straightforward in Portainer. Do click in <b>Endpoints</b>, choose the the endpoint and do a click in <b>Manage Access</b>
