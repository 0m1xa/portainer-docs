# Requirements

Every single release of Portainer goes through an extensive testing process (functional tests, release tests, post release tests) to ensure that what we are creating actually works as expected. Obviously though, we cannot possibly test Portainer against every single configuration variant out there, so we have elected to test against just a subset.

To try and alleviate confusion as to what we test against, we gave documented these configurations are the only configurations that we personally validate as "functional"; any other variant is not tested (this does not mean it wont work, it just means its not tested). 

## Validated Configurations

## Notes

If you report a bug for a configuration that is not on the list above, we will ask you to first update your environment to match a validated configuration before continuing.
