In Portainer, you can create an App template from deployed Stacks. This is really useful when you need to deploy the same stack several times.

Now, you need to define some properties for this new template. 

* Title: Name your new template.
* Description: Short description about your template.
* Notes: You can write notes about this template.
* Icon URL: You can set up a icon from a URL
* Platform: Here, you need to define if your template is ready for use in Linux or Windows environments. 
* Type: Choose between Swarm and Docker Standalone.

Also, you can upload from your computer another compose file or get the file from a Github repository if needed. 

After define this, you can add more services to your template.
