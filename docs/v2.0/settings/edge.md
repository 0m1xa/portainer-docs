# Edge Compute features

In todayâ€™s world you can easily have hundreds - if not thousands - of Docker-enabled devices in your environment. Most of these systems run without any form of clustering or run a lean orchestrator such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

Remote devices may be distributed across multiple sites and/or across many different networks, some may even be attached to the internet using mobile data or satellite. To be managed effectively, engineers need a way to control distributed instances centrally, which is exactly what Portainer does with Edge Computer Features.

## Enabling Edge Compute Features

To start to use this features, you need to enable from the Portainer Settings. 

Once you logged into Portainer, click in <b>Settings</b> and scroll down to <b>Edge Compute</b> section.

Enable the toogle and click in <b>Save Settings</b>

## Edge Groups

Edge Groups is a option that enable you to create groups of Edge endpoints based in a manual selection or in a dynamic way trough <b>tags</b>. This feature is very useful when you manage multiple Edge Endpoints in multiple zones.

To create a group, go to <b>Edge Groups</b> and then a clic in <b>Add Edge Group</b>.

If you choose <b>Dynamic</b> you can choose two options to match via <b>Tags</b> your Edge endpoints. 

* Partial Match: Associate any endpoint matching at least one of the selected tags. (Each endpoint can have multiple tags).

The following step is name your stack and select an or several <b>Edge Groups</b>.

In the <b>Build Methond</b> you need to define how to deploy your app. Several options are available:

* Web Editor: You can use our web editor to write or paste a docker-compose file. 
* Upload: Upload a docker-compose.yml file from your computer
* Repository: Use a git repository where the compose file is. 
* Template: Use an Edge stack template. 

Once this set, do a click in <b>Deploy stack</b>
